# Part2_Colour
Difficulty: Easy/Medium

If you haven't done part 1 go to that first, as this contains the model answer for that
Your new task is to define a function that flashes a different colour for each note and a function that cycles through a colour wheel gradient when a button is pressed
Any issues drop me a message
